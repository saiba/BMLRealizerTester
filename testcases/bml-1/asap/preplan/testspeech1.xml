  	<text>Elckerlyc is a BML compliant behavior realizer for generating multimodal verbal and nonverbal behavior for Virtual Humans (VHs). It is designed specifically for continuous (as opposed to turn-based) interaction with tight temporal coordination between the behavior of a VH and its interaction partners. Animation in Elckerlyc is generated using a mix between the precise temporal and spatial control offered by procedural motion and the naturalness of physical simulation.</text>
